The concern about \"death panels\" was a misinterpretation, and the section in question (Section 1233) was ultimately removed or clarified to address concerns. The ACA does include provisions for end-of-life discussions and Advance Directives, but these are meant to empower patients and their families, not to deny care. The ACA does not involve explicit rationing of care except in extreme circumstances, and the focus is on improving overall healthcare delivery rather than limiting services."}
