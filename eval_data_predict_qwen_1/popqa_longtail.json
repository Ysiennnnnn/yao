However, if we consider the information about the album \"Unfolded Like Staircase\" by the band Discipline, the arranger for that album is listed as Desmond Child and Jeffrey \"C.J.\" Vanston. Since \"Discipline\" (instrumental) could potentially refer to a track on that album, the composer could be inferred to be either Desmond Child or C.J.
