{"id": "tc_201", "result": "The context provided lists various information about the animal crackers, but it doesn't directly state the exact number of different animal shapes in the \"Animal Crackers\" cookie zoo. However, we can piece together the relevant information:\n\n1. Since 1902, 54 different animals have been represented.\n2. In the current incarnation, each package contains 22 cookies with a variety of animals.\n3. The total number of animals featured in Barnum's Animals Crackers since 1903 is mentioned as 106, including the koala added in 2002.\n\nFrom these numbers, we can infer that the number of different animal shapes might be around 106 if considering all the history, but since the current package contains 22 cookies, that would be the more relevant count for the current design.\n\nSo, the possible answer could be \"22 different animal shapes,\" which represents the number of animals typically found in a current package of Animal Crackers. If you want to include the historical total, it would be \"106 different animal shapes.\""}
