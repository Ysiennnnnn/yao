The mention of Gravenhurst, Talk Talk, Savath & Savalas, and International Pony further supports this eclectic mix. If \"My Friend\" refers to the 1983 Bolivian drama film directed by Paolo Agazzi, the genre would be drama, but without more context, it's unclear if this is the same \"friend\" mentioned in the song title. Therefore, the most specific answer would be \"acoustic rock and electronic fusion\" or simply \"drama\" for the film, depending on which \"Me and My Friend\" is being referred to."}

Since the question asks about the album \"Flare,\" without further information, the answer would be \"alternative/indie pop\" or \"experimental pop.\" If the question was asking about the live performances or events organized by Flare Acoustic Arts League, the context suggests a variety of music competitions and collaborations, but the primary focus would still be on the band's music, which would align with the same genres."}

However, since the Canton of Gordes was disbanded and its communes joined the Canton of Apt in 2015, it implies that Gordes was likely the administrative center before its dissolution.

If it's not clear, the answer would be \"the capital of the respective voivodeship,\" which would be Łódź (Voivodeship), Garwolin (Masovian Voivodeship), or Rzeszów (Subcarpathian Voivodeship)."}
